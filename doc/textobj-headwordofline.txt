INTERFACE					*textobj-headwordofline-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAPPINGS					*textobj-headwordofline-mappings*

These key mappings are defined in Visual mode and Operator-pending mode.

<Plug>(textobj-headwordofline-a)			*<Plug>(textobj-headwordofline-a)*
			Select the head word of line.

<Plug>(textobj-headwordofline-i)			*<Plug>(textobj-headwordofline-i)*
			Like |<Plug>(textobj-headwordofline-a)|, but trailing
			spaces are excluded.

CUSTOMIZING					*textobj-headwordofline-customizing*

				    *g:textobj_headwordofline_no_default_key_mappings*
					    *:TextobjheadwordoflineDefaultKeyMappings*
This plugin will define the following key mappings in Visual mode and
Operator-pending mode automatically.  If you don't want these key mappings,
define |g:textobj_headwordofline_no_default_key_mappings| before this plugin is loaded
(e.g. in your |vimrc|).  You can also use |:TextobjheadwordoflineDefaultKeyMappings|
to redefine these key mappings.  This command doesn't override existing {lhs}s
unless [!] is given.
